Motoring campaigners and the RAC highlight that these LED 'upgrades' are often replacing older halogen bulbs, causing significant glare and posing a safety risk. A survey found that 91% of drivers have experienced dazzling from headlights, with nearly 7% avoiding night driving due to the issue. The Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency states that LED bulbs can only be legally used if fitted as standard in new cars. The government has been urged to investigate further, as many drivers may be unaware of the illegality and safety implications of these modifications."

This growth is part of a broader effort to expand EV infrastructure across the UK, aiming to meet the government's target of 300,000 public chargers by 2030. Despite this progress, the RAC has raised concerns about the uneven distribution of chargers, noting disparities in accessibility across different regions. Fife currently has 61 public chargers per 100,000 people, with 45 being rapid chargers. The Department for Transport emphasizes its commitment to accelerating the rollout to ensure widespread access and encourage the transition to zero-emission vehicles."

Instead, they recommend a safe five-step routine: ensure wipers are not frozen, start the engine with warm air directed at the windscreen, remove all snow from the vehicle, use a scraper and de-icer on the outside while the interior warms up, and only drive once the glass is clear. This advice comes in response to ineffective and potentially harmful hacks, such as using hot water, which can crack the glass, or rubbing potatoes on windows, which can cause smearing."

This marks a significant improvement from previous years, attributed to advancements in battery technology, increased charging infrastructure, and better driver education. The AA notes that the trend aligns with similar patterns in Norway, which has a high EV adoption rate. The report highlights an 80% reduction in out-of-charge incidents over eight years, suggesting enhanced EV reliability. Despite these improvements, some drivers remain hesitant about transitioning to EVs due to uncertainties about ownership and charging logistics."

These dangerous actions, captured over two years, have prompted safety concerns as crews service thousands of properties daily. Biffa, the company operating the service, reports that workers also face verbal abuse. Offenders risk fines and legal action, with such behavior classified under dangerous driving offences. Authorities emphasize the need for patience and consideration on the roads to prevent potential harm to workers and the public."

This decline raises concerns about inconsistent charger availability across the UK, as highlighted by the RAC. Despite a national increase of 47% in charger installations, Dudley has only 55 public chargers per 100,000 people. The UK government aims to install 300,000 public chargers by 2030, requiring 3,600 new chargers monthly. The RAC emphasizes the need to prioritize areas with poor charger access, noting significant regional disparities, with London having a third of the country's chargers. The Department for Transport remains committed to accelerating charger rollout to support the transition to zero-emission vehicles."

Zheng advises that China should counteract by expanding its unilateral opening-up strategies, particularly towards the U.S., to gain leverage in the ongoing rivalry. He predicts that while Trump's return might cause short-term economic and trade disruptions for China, it could simultaneously reduce geopolitical tensions. Zheng also warns that Trump's \"America First\" policy and potential tariff increases could severely harm both U.S.-China relations and the global trade system."
