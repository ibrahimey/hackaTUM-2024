The RAC has highlighted the safety risks, noting that one in 20 drivers have reported near-collisions due to headlight glare. Campaigners from Lightaware warn that replacing halogen bulbs with LEDs can cause poor beam alignment and glare, as halogen housings are not compatible with LED bulbs. Despite being marketed as 'halogen replacements,' these LED bulbs are only legal for use on private land. Many drivers may unknowingly break the law until their vehicle fails its MoT. The government has commissioned further research into this issue, as 91% of surveyed drivers reported being dazzled by headlights, with 74% experiencing it regularly."

In Fife, there are 61 public chargers per 100,000 people, including 45 rapid chargers. The UK government aims to install 300,000 public EV chargers by 2030, requiring approximately 3,600 new installations monthly.

Instead, they recommend a five-step routine: checking that wipers are not frozen, starting the engine with warm air directed at the windscreen, removing all snow from the car, using a scraper and de-icer on the outside, and ensuring all glass is clear before driving. The AA emphasizes that using hot or cold water on windscreens can cause cracking or further freezing, leading to costly repairs."

This marks a significant improvement from previous years, attributed to advancements in battery technology, increased charger availability, and better driver education. The AA reports handling around 8,000 vehicle breakdowns daily, with only a small fraction involving EVs running out of charge. The trend aligns with similar patterns in Norway, suggesting that range anxiety is diminishing. The AA anticipates EV reliability will soon match that of conventional vehicles, though some drivers remain hesitant about transitioning to EVs."

During Road Safety Awareness Week, Cornwall Council released footage showing vehicles mounting pavements and narrowly avoiding waste collection crews, violating Highway Code rule 145. Over the past two years, CCTV has captured numerous incidents, prompting safety concerns as these crews service up to 2,500 properties daily. Biffa, the collection service operator, reports that workers also face verbal abuse. Offenders risk fines, court summons, or mandatory education courses for such dangerous driving, which is classified by the Metropolitan Police as a serious offence. Councillor Carol Mould and Roads Policing Temporary Chief Inspector Dean Drury emphasize the need for patience and consideration on the roads to prevent potential injuries or fatalities."

This decline raises concerns about inconsistent EV charger availability across the UK, with the RAC highlighting disparities in charger distribution. While the government aims to install 300,000 public chargers by 2030, Dudley currently has 55 chargers per 100,000 people, which is below the national average. The RAC emphasizes the need for prioritizing regions with poor charger access to ensure equitable EV infrastructure development. Despite these challenges, the UK is on track to meet its 2030 target, with 65,000 chargers installed nationally as of July, marking a 47% increase from the previous year."

        "generated_summary": "China's primary concern during a potential second term for Donald Trump as U.S. president is the possibility of significant U.S. government changes influenced by tech mogul Elon Musk, according to Zheng Yongnian, a prominent Chinese political scientist. Zheng advises that China should counter this by expanding its unilateral opening-up measures, particularly towards the U.S., to gain leverage in the ongoing US-China rivalry. He predicts that while Trump's policies might lead to short-term economic and trade disruptions for China, geopolitical tensions could lessen. Zheng also warns that Trump's \"America First\" strategy, particularly through tariffs, could severely harm bilateral relations and the global trade system."
