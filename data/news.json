Ford, which once supported the policy, now calls it \"unworkable\" and has announced 800 job cuts in the UK. The mandate targets 22% EV sales in 2024, rising to 28% by 2025, with fines for non-compliance. The industry faces challenges from the high upfront costs of EVs, insufficient public charging infrastructure, and opposition to net-zero policies. Despite the lobbying for more flexible rules, the UK government remains focused on climate goals, with some departments more open to adjustments than others. There is concern that strict mandates could threaten jobs and investments, while charger companies and environmental groups advocate for maintaining the targets."

This three-masted sailing yacht, built by Oceanco in the Netherlands, is one of the world's most prestigious and was the second-largest of its kind when commissioned. The yacht, accompanied by a $75 million support vessel named Abeona, costs approximately $35 million annually to maintain. While it's unclear if Bezos or his partner Lauren Sanchez are onboard during this voyage, the yacht's presence may be for routine equipment trials. Koru previously visited Palma two years ago during its maiden voyage, with Bezos and Sanchez arriving by private jet and helicopter."

        "generated_summary": "Nissan has issued an urgent warning to the UK Government to revise the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandate, as current targets threaten the UK automotive sector. The Japanese automaker, which operates the largest car manufacturing plant in Sunderland, highlighted that electric vehicle sales are lagging behind the mandate's ambitious goals. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) projects EV sales to reach only 18.5% of the market this year, short of the 22% target for 2024. The targets are set to rise to 28% in 2025 and eventually to 100% by 2035. Failure to meet these could result in substantial penalties for manufacturers, potentially costing \u00a315,000 per non-compliant vehicle. Nissan argues that this could lead to manufacturers buying credits from foreign EV-only brands, effectively subsidizing other countries' sectors. To address this, Nissan proposes allowing more flexibility in credit borrowing and a two-year monitoring period to avert fines. Nissan's commitment to UK manufacturing is significant, with over 7,000 employees and investments in new EV production as part of its EV36Zero initiative. The company stresses the urgent need for government action to prevent an irreversible impact on the industry."

The company, which operates a major gigafactory in Skellefte\u00e5, Sweden, has been hit hard by declining demand for electric vehicles (EVs) in Europe and increased competition from cheaper Chinese alternatives. This downturn has led to reduced investments from major clients like BMW and the withdrawal of planned government funding. Northvolt's debts have reached nearly $6 billion, and it has already shut down several divisions. Founder and CEO Peter Carlsson has resigned, taking responsibility for the company's over-ambitious expansion plans. The company is now seeking a fresh capital injection of $1 billion to $1.2 billion to avoid being sold for parts. The situation highlights Europe's vulnerability in the battery supply chain, with experts warning of increased reliance on China if Northvolt cannot recover."

The company, which aimed to be a leading player in Europe's battery industry, faced significant challenges including production issues, overspending, and a slowdown in electric vehicle demand. Northvolt's financial troubles were exacerbated by canceled contracts, such as a \u20ac2 billion deal with BMW, and financial struggles faced by its top investor, Volkswagen. Despite these setbacks, the company plans to continue operations at its key facilities in Sweden, Germany, and North America, and is seeking $1 to $1.2 billion in new funding to stabilize its finances. The Swedish government has declined to intervene, while German officials are unable to assist due to their own economic challenges. Northvolt's situation highlights the difficulties Europe faces in establishing a competitive battery industry amidst global competition, particularly from China."

The car's maximum power output will increase from 577bhp to 641bhp, with torque rising to 770Nm when in 'GT' mode. This upgrade is expected to improve its 0-62mph acceleration time, potentially matching the Hyundai Ioniq 5 N's 3.4 seconds. The EV6 GT will also incorporate a 'Virtual Gear Shift' from the Ioniq 5 N, simulating gear changes to enhance the driving experience. A synthesised engine soundtrack will accompany this feature, although both can be disabled for a traditional electric car feel. Unlike the Ioniq 5 N, the EV6 GT will not have stiffer suspension, maintaining a softer ride. It will utilize an 84kWh battery, potentially enhancing its range from the previous 263 miles. Styling updates include new daytime running lights and a revised front end, along with interior enhancements like a new steering wheel and updated infotainment system. The updated model is expected to be available in 2025."

This includes potential repeals of tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act and increased tariffs on Chinese vehicles and components. Such actions might hinder U.S. automakers' ability to compete globally, despite the persistent international demand for EVs. Ford CEO Jim Farley has described Chinese EVs as an \"existential threat\" to U.S. manufacturers, highlighting the potential impact of Trump's policies on the American automotive industry."

Despite initial tensions, Musk has become a significant figure in Trump's administration, advising on appointments and policies. This alliance raises concerns about potential conflicts of interest, as Musk's companies benefit from public contracts while facing federal investigations. Musk's role in the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency, which aims to reduce government spending and regulation, is critiqued as largely symbolic. The partnership is seen as fragile, with analysts skeptical about its longevity due to the personalities involved. The article suggests that while Musk's influence is substantial, the non-binding nature of his recommendations limits their impact."

In contrast, other councils pay out on an average of 20% of claims. Gloucestershire County Council attributes this to their robust system of inspections and repairs, which they claim minimizes the need to use taxpayer funds for compensation. Simon Williams, the head of policy at the RAC, noted that councils often avoid compensation by claiming unawareness of potholes. The council is currently trialling new methods to improve road conditions, including the use of advanced repair machines and proactive repair teams. Despite these efforts, the council acknowledges that it's challenging to inspect and repair every pothole immediately, especially in winter."

The company, which aimed to rival dominant Asian battery manufacturers, has struggled with production issues and cash flow problems. Northvolt needs to raise between $1 billion and $1.2 billion to stabilize its business. Despite securing $100 million in new financing, the company only has enough cash to operate for about a week. The bankruptcy filing follows unsuccessful talks for rescue investments and a recent announcement to cut 1,600 jobs. Northvolt has faced criticism for trying to build multiple factories simultaneously and losing BMW as a major customer. The Swedish government and stakeholders like Scania continue to support Northvolt, hoping restructuring will revive its fortunes. The company plans to complete its restructuring by the first quarter of 2025, while competition from established Asian firms remains intense."

Data from the RAC revealed that claims surged from 8,327 to 20,432, with Surrey and Hampshire witnessing the most significant increases. Despite this, only 15% of claims were compensated, with councils frequently citing a lack of prior knowledge under Section 58 of the Highways Act 1980 to reject claims. Some councils, like Gloucestershire and Hertfordshire, rejected nearly all claims based on this reasoning. The average compensation payout is \u00a3260, often insufficient to cover repair costs. Labour has pledged an additional \u00a3500 million in the budget to address potholes, aiming to repair one million more per year. The Department for Transport is also investing in road maintenance, emphasizing cost-efficient solutions for taxpayers."

The Bluebird, which was destroyed in a 1967 crash, has been rebuilt after being recovered from Coniston Water 34 years later. Following a legal dispute over ownership, the Ruskin Museum now holds the craft, and plans to refurbish its Orpheus jet engines. Dave Warby, who aims to break the water speed record with his own craft, Spirit of Australia II, expressed honor at piloting Bluebird, which inspired his father's records. His reserve pilot will be RAF Flt Lt David-John Gibbs."

Musk, who has endorsed Trump and donated significantly to his re-election campaign, has been appointed to lead a new advisory body under Trump's administration. His close ties with Chinese leaders, including a strong relationship with Premier Li Qiang and President Xi Jinping, have facilitated Tesla's significant investments in China, including a major factory in Shanghai. This factory, which benefits from favorable loans and tax rates, is pivotal for Tesla as it aligns with China's economic priorities in high-tech industries. Musk's influence may help mitigate the impact of Trump's proposed tariffs on Chinese imports, which could otherwise harm Tesla's operations. Analysts suggest Musk could negotiate exemptions for Tesla, highlighting his strategic importance in the ongoing geopolitical and economic dynamics between the US and China."
